                    <p class="lead mb-5">I am currently a student at John Jay college and a developer with a passion for programming as well as CyberSecurity. I was introduced to Cyber Security during my time in High School. Where I was taught Cyber Security and the basics of IT, then afterwards I was able to take the ITF+ certification. This led to me having a passion for networking and become more focused on expanding my knowledge on the topic. I also developed a passion for programming when I was introduced to it college, and I would attempt to build basic programs such as a calculator. Recently I have just gotten into web development and joined Cuny TTP program to expand my knowledge of programming. My interest for web development was piqued from the creative aspect of the front end, editing the css of a website and the overall format of the site. However I am just as interested in the back end as much as I am interested in the front end due to the technical aspects from things such as the API.</p>
